**QuickBite** is a niche food ordering web application tailored for closed campus environments. It solves the problem of overcrowding in college canteens by allowing students to:

2.  **Order** food from a digital menu.
3.  **Track** their live queue position and food preparation status in real-time.

It features a modern **"Pro Motion"** user interface with glassmorphism, staggered animations, and a seamless checkout experience.
